# Home-automatisation
Long ago I asked myself what bigger projects I could possibly do with my RaspberryPi and my ESP-32.
I thought it would be nice to link them somehow together.
So I decided to make a little home-automatisation.

The reason behind this project ist that I dont know a lot about website programming and javascript, but a lot more about server programming with C/C++, Java or Rust. To improve my knowledge in web development, I was planing to operate 
these devices through an web interface. 

Project aims:
- build a big LED matrix, which I could hang on my wall to show different light modes
- program different methods, which can be called to show the light shows
- program Tetris, which can be played through my website
- program a Raspberry/ESP-32 as server to control the Devices
    * Try to implement an API to let the website add and remove different devices (Maybe I should implement a Database
    * Send sensor data to the website such as temperature or humidity
- program the website to show and control the devices
    * program a good looking website
    * Implement an API to add more devices to my server

- (Optional) program a mobile App to control my devices
    * (Optional) implement a bluetooth connection into the app to control the LED-matrix
